# DualPointerX
A tool to easily create and manage multiple pointers via xinput (MPX)

You know those timees when you and a friend want to use the same computer at the same time. Like when you want to work on an assigment and your friend wants to edit his resume. Before you either had to take turns or just split up the keyboard/mouse focus. 

Now, you can just plug in a seperate physical mice/keyboards and both use the same computer simunteously properly 
DualPointerX automates the functionality MPX functionality built into X11 to create multiple virtual devices each enslaving disctrinct physical devices. The result is you have multiple mouse cursors each controlled by multiple physical devices
